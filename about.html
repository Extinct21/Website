            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            Hi, my name is Christian and I am currently a student in the Seneca College for computer
            science. I have gained interest over this particular subject through my highschool days.
            I picked chess for this project as it was the first game that fascinated me during my
            childhood. I quite liked the complexity that it brings to the table.
